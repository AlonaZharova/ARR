## Abstract

Publications are a vital element of any scientist’s career. It is not only the number of media
outlets but aslo the quality of published research that enters decisions on jobs, salary,
tenure, etc. Academic ranking scales in economics and other disciplines are, therefore,
widely used in classification, judgment and scientific depth of individual research. These
ranking systems are competing, allow for different disciplinary gravity and sometimes give
orthogonal results. Here a statistical analysis of the interconnection between Handelsblatt
(HB), Research Papers in Economics (RePEc, here RP) and Google Scholar (GS) systems
is presented. Quantile regression allows us to successfully predict missing ranking data
and to obtain a so-called HB Common Score and to carry out a cross-rankings analysis.
Based on the merged ranking data from different data providers, we discuss the ranking
systems dependence, analyze the age effect and study the relationship between the research
expertise areas and the ranking performance.
