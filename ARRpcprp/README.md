Datafile : 'ARRdata.dat - The data set contains different researcher (3218 rows) of either RePEc
(77 columns), Handelsblatt (48 columns) ranking or both and their Google Scholar data (16 columns)
as well as age and subject fields (2 columns)'

Output: 
- 1: 'Parallel coordinates plot for RP average rank score and ranks from 36 subrankings for
selected researchers in December 2015. Red lines denote the three quartiles (25%, 50% and 75%)'
- 2: 'Parallel coordinates plot for RP average rank score and ranks from 36 subrankings for
selected researchers in December 2015. The red dashed lines denote three quartiles (25%, 50% and
75%) that are shown for all individuals. Grey lines denote scores of top 100 researchers, while
blue lines indicate scores of top 10 researchers, according to RP average rank score'
