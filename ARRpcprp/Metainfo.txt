Datafile : 'ARRdata.dat - The data set contains different researcher (3218 rows) 
of either RePEc (77 columns), Handelsblatt (48 columns) ranking or both and their 
Google Scholar data (16 columns) as well as age and subject fields (2 columns)'

Output : 
- 1: 'Parallel coordinates plot for RP average rank score and ranks from 36 subrankings
for selected researchers in December 2015. Red lines denote the three quartiles (25%, 50% and 
75%)'
- 2: 'Parallel coordinates plot for RP average rank score and ranks from 36 subrankings
for selected researchers in December 2015. The red dashed lines denote three
quartiles (25%, 50% and 75%) that are shown for all individuals. Grey lines denote scores
of top 100 researchers, while blue lines indicate scores of top 10 researchers, according to
RP average rank score'
