Datafile : 'ARRdata.csv - The data set contains different researcher (3218 rows) 
of either RePEc (77 columns), Handelsblatt (48 columns) ranking or both and their 
Google Scholar data (16 columns) as well as age and subject fields (2 columns)'

Output : 'Scatterplot and Quantile Regression Fit (left) of the HB on VWL LW vs BWL
LW for a sample of 100 top researchers within these rankings. Superimposed on the
plot is the 0.50 quantile regression line (solid blue) and the least squares estimate of
the conditional mean function (dashed red line). The coefficient of determination of the
median regression equals to 0.93. A QQ plot (right) of the same sample of data versus a
normal distribution'
